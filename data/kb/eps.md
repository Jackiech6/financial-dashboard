# Earnings Per Share (EPS)

## What is EPS?

Earnings Per Share (EPS) is a financial metric that represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It's a key indicator of a company's profitability.

## Formula

EPS = (Net Income - Preferred Dividends) ÷ Average Outstanding Shares

## Types of EPS

- **Diluted EPS**: Accounts for potential shares (options, warrants)
- **Trailing EPS**: Based on past 12 months
- **Forward EPS**: Based on projected earnings

## Interpretation

- **EPS Growth**: Increasing EPS over time is positive
- **Negative EPS**: Company is losing money

## Use in Valuation
