# Asset Allocation

## What is Asset Allocation?

Asset allocation is an investment strategy that divides a portfolio among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. The goal is to balance risk and reward by diversifying investments across different asset classes.

## Key Principles

- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset types
- **Risk Tolerance**: Match allocation to your risk comfort level
- **Time Horizon**: Longer horizons may allow more aggressive allocations
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically adjust to maintain target allocation

## Common Asset Classes

- **Stocks (Equities)**: Higher risk, higher potential return
- **Bonds (Fixed Income)**: Lower risk, steady income
- **Cash/Cash Equivalents**: Lowest risk, liquidity
- **Real Estate**: Alternative investment
- **Commodities**: Hedge against inflation

## Allocation Strategies

- **Age-Based**: 100 minus your age = % in stocks
- **Risk-Based**: Conservative, moderate, aggressive
- **Goal-Based**: Match allocation to specific financial goals
