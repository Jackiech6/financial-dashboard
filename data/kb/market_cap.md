# Market Capitalization

## What is Market Cap?

Market capitalization (market cap) is the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It's calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of shares outstanding.

## Formula

Market Cap = Stock Price × Total Shares Outstanding

## Market Cap Categories

- **Large-Cap**: $10 billion or more (e.g., Apple, Microsoft)
- **Mid-Cap**: $2 billion to $10 billion
- **Small-Cap**: $300 million to $2 billion
- **Micro-Cap**: Less than $300 million

## Why It Matters

Market cap helps investors:
- Understand company size
- Compare companies
- Assess risk levels
- Build diversified portfolios

## Limitations

Market cap doesn't reflect:
- Company's actual asset value
- Debt levels
- Future growth potential
- Market conditions

## Use Cases

- Portfolio diversification
- Risk assessment
- Investment strategy selection
- Market analysis
