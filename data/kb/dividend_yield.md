# Dividend Yield

## What is Dividend Yield?

Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. It's expressed as a percentage.

## Formula

Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividends per Share ÷ Stock Price) × 100

## Example

If a stock pays $2 per share annually and trades at $50:
Dividend Yield = ($2 ÷ $50) × 100 = 4%

## Interpretation

- **High Yield**: May indicate good income potential or potential risk
- **Low Yield**: May indicate growth focus or financial stress
- **No Yield**: Company may reinvest profits instead of paying dividends

## Types of Dividend Stocks

- **Dividend Aristocrats**: Companies that have increased dividends for 25+ years
- **High-Yield Stocks**: Stocks with above-average dividend yields
- **Growth Stocks**: Often pay low or no dividends

## Considerations

- Dividend sustainability
- Company financial health
- Tax implications
- Total return (dividends + capital gains)
