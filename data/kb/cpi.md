# Consumer Price Index (CPI)

## What is CPI?

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. It's a key indicator of inflation.

## How CPI Works

- Tracks price changes for a basket of goods and services
- Represents spending patterns of urban consumers
- Reported monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
- Base year is set to 100, changes are relative to that

## Types of CPI

- **CPI-U**: Urban consumers (most common)
- **CPI-W**: Urban wage earners and clerical workers
- **Core CPI**: Excludes food and energy (volatile items)

## Why It Matters

- **Inflation Indicator**: Shows how much prices are rising
- **Economic Policy**: Guides Federal Reserve decisions
- **Cost of Living**: Used for Social Security adjustments
- **Investment Decisions**: Affects interest rates and markets

## Impact on Investments

- Rising CPI may lead to higher interest rates
- Bonds typically perform poorly during high inflation
- Stocks may be affected by inflation expectations
- Real assets (real estate, commodities) may benefit

## Limitations

- May not reflect individual spending patterns
- Doesn't account for quality changes
- Different regions have different inflation rates
