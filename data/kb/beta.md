# Beta in Stock Analysis

## What is Beta?

Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility relative to the overall market. It indicates how much a stock's price moves compared to the market as a whole (typically the S&P 500).

## Beta Values

- **Beta = 1.0**: Stock moves with the market
- **Beta > 1.0**: Stock is more volatile than market (aggressive)
- **Beta < 1.0**: Stock is less volatile than market (defensive)
- **Beta < 0**: Stock moves opposite to market (rare)

## Interpretation

- **High Beta (1.5+)**: Higher risk, higher potential returns
- **Low Beta (0.5-1.0)**: Lower risk, more stable
- **Negative Beta**: Moves opposite to market

## Use Cases

- Risk assessment
- Portfolio construction
- Expected return calculation (CAPM)

## Limitations

- Based on historical data
- May not predict future volatility
- Market conditions change

Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)
