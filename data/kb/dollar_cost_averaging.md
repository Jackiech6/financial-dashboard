# Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

## What is Dollar-Cost Averaging?

Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset's price. This approach helps reduce the impact of volatility on your investments.

## How It Works

- Invest the same dollar amount regularly (e.g., monthly)
- Buy more shares when prices are low
- Buy fewer shares when prices are high
- Average cost per share over time

## Example

Investing $100 monthly:
- Month 1: $10/share = 10 shares
- Month 2: $12/share = 8.33 shares
- Month 3: $8/share = 12.5 shares
- Average cost: Lower than average price

## Benefits

- Reduces timing risk
- Disciplined investing approach
- Less emotional decision-making
- Smooths out market volatility

## Limitations

- May miss out on lump-sum gains in rising markets
- Requires consistent cash flow
- Doesn't guarantee profits
- Transaction costs may add up

## Use Cases

- 401(k) contributions
- Regular investment plans
- Building long-term wealth
- Reducing market timing anxiety
