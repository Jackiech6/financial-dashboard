# Portfolio Rebalancing

## What is Rebalancing?

Rebalancing is the process of realigning the weightings of assets in a portfolio to maintain a desired asset allocation. It involves buying or selling assets to restore the original target allocation.

## Why Rebalance?

- **Maintain Risk Level**: Prevent drift from target allocation
- **Lock in Gains**: Sell assets that have appreciated
- **Buy Low**: Purchase assets that have declined
- **Stay Disciplined**: Stick to your investment strategy

## Rebalancing Strategies

- **Time-Based**: Rebalance at fixed intervals (quarterly, annually)
- **Threshold-Based**: Rebalance when allocation drifts by a set percentage (e.g., 5%)
- **Hybrid**: Combine time and threshold approaches

## Process

1. Review current allocation
2. Compare to target allocation
3. Calculate needed adjustments
4. Execute trades to rebalance
5. Consider tax implications

## Considerations

- Transaction costs
- Tax consequences (capital gains)
- Market timing concerns
- Rebalancing frequency

## Benefits

- Maintains risk profile
- Forces disciplined selling high and buying low
- Prevents over-concentration
- Aligns with long-term goals
