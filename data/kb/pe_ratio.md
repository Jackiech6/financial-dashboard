# Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

## What is P/E Ratio?

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is a fundamental valuation metric used by investors to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. It's calculated by dividing a company's current stock price by its earnings per share (EPS).

## Formula

P/E Ratio = Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share

## Interpretation

- **High P/E Ratio**: May indicate the stock is overvalued, or investors expect high growth
- **Low P/E Ratio**: May indicate the stock is undervalued, or the company has growth concerns
- **Context Matters**: Compare P/E ratios within the same industry

## Types of P/E Ratios

- **Trailing P/E**: Uses past 12 months of earnings
- **Forward P/E**: Uses projected future earnings

## Limitations

P/E ratio alone doesn't tell the whole story. Consider:
- Industry averages
- Company growth prospects
- Economic conditions
- Other financial metrics
