- **Corporate Bonds**: Issued by companies
- **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by local governments
- **Zero-Coupon Bonds**: No periodic interest payments

## Bond Ratings

Credit rating agencies (Moody's, S&P) rate bonds:
- **Investment Grade**: Lower risk (AAA to BBB-)
- **High Yield (Junk)**: Higher risk, higher return (BB+ and below)

## Risks
