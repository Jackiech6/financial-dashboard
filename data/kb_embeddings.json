It's calculated by dividing a company's current stock price by its earnings per share (EPS).\n\n## Formula\n\nP/E Ratio = Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share\n\n## Interpretation\n\n- **High P/E Ratio**: May indicate the stock is overvalued, or investors expect high growth\n- **Low P/E Ratio**: May indicate the stock is undervalued, or the company has growth concerns\n- **Context Matters**: Compare P/E ratios within the same industry\n\n## Types of P/E Ratios\n\n- **Trailing P/E**: Uses past 12 months of earnings\n- **Forward P/E**: Uses projected future earnings\n\n## Limitations\n\nP/E ratio alone doesn't tell the whole story. Consider:\n- Industry averages\n- Company growth prospects\n- Economic conditions\n- Other financial metrics",
